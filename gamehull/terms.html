                reference to the "Software" includes but is not limited to the material and information contained in the
                Software, including any services, content, data, text, images, links, sounds, graphics, RSS, API,

                referred to as "you" or "your" as the context requires.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>1.2 &nbsp;You agree that by accessing, downloading, installing and/or using our Software or any account
                registration or logging, you are agreeing to be bound to this Agreement. In addition, when using our
                Software, you may be subject to any posted guidelines or rules applicable to such Software which may be
                posted from time to time.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>1.3 &nbsp;We may update this Agreement from time to time by posting the amended terms in our Software or
                websites. Your continued use of our Software will be deemed as your acceptance of the updated agreement.
                IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, PLEASE DO NOT USE THE SOFTWARE (OR IMMEDIATELY
                DISCONTINUE YOUR USE AND/OR ACCESS OF THE SAME).</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>1.4 &nbsp;BY ACCESSING AND/OR USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU CONSENT TO ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS

                the United States, by agreeing to this Agreement, you agree (a) to resolve all disputes with us related
                to the Software through binding individual arbitration, which means that you waive any right to have
                those disputes decided by a judge or jury, and (b) to waive your right to participate in class actions,
                class arbitrations, or representative actions in connection with your use of the Software. You may have
                the right to opt-out of arbitration as explained in Section 13.2.</p>

            <h2><strong>2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Free Trial and Accounts</strong></h2>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>2.1 &nbsp;Your use of the Software may start with a free trial. The free trial period for your use of the
                Software lasts for three (3) days, or as otherwise specified during sign-up. Free trials may not be
                combined with any other offers.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>2.2 &nbsp;By signing up for an account on the Software (“Account”), you represent and warrant that: (a)
                you are of legal age or have the full right, power, and legal authority to enter into this Agreement;
                (b) you will not authorise other persons (save for your authorised Child as further described below) to
                use your account; and (c) you are not impersonating any other person, operating under an alias or
                otherwise concealing your identity. Subject to the laws of your residence country, minor children may
                utilize an account established by their parent or legal guardian. If you permit your minor child or
                legal ward (collectively, your "Child") to use an account, you hereby agree to this Agreement on behalf
                of yourself and your Child, and you understand and agree that you will be responsible for all uses of
                the account by your Child whether or not such uses were authorized by you.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>2.3 &nbsp;By subscribing to the Services, you agree to become a subscriber (Subscriber) for the period
                you have elected. A full list of subscription plans and pricing is available in the Software. Your
                subscription will continue and automatically renew until terminated. You must cancel your subscription
                before it renews in order to avoid billing of subscription fees for the next billing cycle to your
                payment method (see “Cancellation” below). You may cancel your subscription at any time; however, there
                are no refunds or credits for partially used periods. We reserve the right to amend subscription fees or
                institute new fees at any time upon reasonable advance notice posted within the Software, on your
                Account, or sent via email. Any changes to the pricing will not affect the Subscriber’s current
                subscription period and will become effective upon subscription renewal.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>2.4 &nbsp;Subscription purchases and refunds are handled via multiple third-party payment companies. To
                find out more about these third-party payment companies and how they process your data, please refer to
                our Privacy Policy. Each paid subscription grants you one (1) license to use our Services on one (1)
                device at any given time. If you want to use the Services on more than one (1) device at a time, you
                should purchase additional subscription plans.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>2.5 &nbsp;You agree that you will make necessary efforts to protect your account information and keep it
                confidential. You agree that you may not transfer your account as well as any of your rights or
                obligations under this Agreement to anyone else or unless expressly stated otherwise share your account
                information with others without our prior consent.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>2.6 &nbsp;You agree that, unless otherwise specified, the system will first debit from the balance of the
                Virtual Points (as defined below) that you paid for (“Top-up Balance”) when you make purchases in the
                Service, and then debit from the balance of the Virtual Points that you earn for free if the Top-up
                Balance is insufficient. Your purchase will fail if both payment methods are unavailable.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <h2><strong>13 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regional Terms</strong></h2>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>13.1 &nbsp;Regional Terms</p>

            <p>You agree to the following modifications to this Agreement if you are a citizen or habitual resident of
                the applicable country or region as described below.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>13.2 &nbsp;United States</p>

            <p>If you are a citizen or habitual resident of the United States, this Section 13.2 applies to your use of
                the Game and overrides any terms of this Agreement that conflict with this Section 13.2 to the extent of
                such conflict, including Section 11.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>13.2.1 &nbsp;Informal Process First</p>

            <p>You agree that in the event of any dispute between you and the GameHULL Pte. Ltd., you will first
                contact GameHULL and make a good faith sustained effort to resolve the dispute before resorting to
                more formal means of resolution, including without limitation, any court action.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>13.2.2 &nbsp;Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver</p>

            <p>After the informal dispute resolution process, any remaining dispute, controversy, or claim
                (collectively, "Claim") relating in any way to your use of GameHULL’s services and/or products,
                including the Game, will be resolved by arbitration, including threshold questions of arbitrability of
                the Claim. You and GameHULL agree that any Claim will be settled by final and binding arbitration,
                using the English language, administered by JAMS under its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and
                Procedures and the JAMS Consumer Minimum Standards (together, the "JAMS Rules") then in effect (those
                rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference into this section, and as of the date of this
                Agreement). Arbitration will be handled by a sole arbitrator in accordance with the JAMS Rules. Judgment
                on the arbitration award may be entered in any court that has jurisdiction. You have a right to have the
                arbitration conducted via telephone, or as an in-person hearing in your hometown area (if you live in
                the United States) or another location that is reasonably convenient to you.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>13.2.3 &nbsp;Waiver of Class Actions and Class Arbitrations</p>

            <p>You and GameHULL agree that each party may bring Claims against the other party only in an
                individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative
                proceeding, including without limitation federal or state class actions, or class arbitrations.
                &nbsp;Accordingly, under the arbitration procedures outlined in this section, an arbitrator shall not
                combine or consolidate more than one party’s claims without the written consent of all affected parties
                to an arbitration proceeding. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you and GameHULL
                agree that no dispute shall proceed by way of class arbitration without the written consent of all
                affected parties.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>13.2.4 &nbsp;Costs of Arbitration</p>

            <p>Payment for any and all reasonable JAMS filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be in accordance
                with the JAMS Rules. If the value of your claim does not exceed $1000, GameHULL will pay for the
                reasonable filing, administrative and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration, unless the
                arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought was frivolous or brought
                for an improper purpose, except that if you have initiated the arbitration claim, you will still be
                required to pay the lesser of $250 or the maximum amount permitted under the JAMS Rules for arbitration
                claims initiated by you. You are still responsible for all additional costs that you incur in the
                arbitration, including without limitation, fees for attorneys or expert witnesses.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>13.2.5 &nbsp;Opt-Out</p>

            <p>You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and waiver of class provisions set
                forth in this Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to
                legal@GameHULL.com. The notice must be sent to GameHULL within thirty (30) days of your
                registering to use the Software or agreeing to this Agreement (or if this Section 13.2 is amended
                hereafter, within thirty (30) days of such amendment being effective), otherwise you shall be bound to
                arbitrate disputes in accordance with this Agreement, and the notice must specify your name and mailing
                address. If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, GameHULL also will not be bound by them.
            </p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>13.2.6 &nbsp;Exceptions</p>

            <p>Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, you may instead assert your Claim in "small
                claims" court, but only if your Claim qualifies, your Claim remains only in such court, and your Claim
                remains on an individual, non-representative and non-class basis. Further, you and GameHULL will
                have the right to bring an action in a court of proper jurisdiction for injunctive or other equitable or
                conservatory relief, or if the Claim relates to intellectual property infringement or misappropriation.

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>13.2.7 &nbsp;Governing Law; Venue</p>

            <p>This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York, without regard to conflict of laws
                rules, and the proper venue for any disputes arising out of or relating to any of the same will be the
                arbitration venue set forth in this Section 13.2, or if arbitration does not apply, then the state and
                federal courts located in Los Angeles county, California. &nbsp;You and GameHULL agree that the
                United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply to the
                interpretation or construction of this Agreement.</p>
